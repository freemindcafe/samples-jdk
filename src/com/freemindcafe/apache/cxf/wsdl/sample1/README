Setup
========
	helloworld.wsdl file had xsd types definition and wsdl service definition
	
	build.xml has apache-cxf-wsdl-cxfWSDLToJava target, this will generated the source code
	under build/generated-src using xmlbeans binding.
	
	include build/generated-src in build path as source folder.
	
	Generate the Client and Server Keystores
	---------------------------------------------
		keytool -genkeypair -alias serverkey -keyalg RSA -dname "CN=localhost,OU=Organization Unit,O=Organization,L=City,S=State,C=IN" -keypass password -keystore serverkeystore.jks -storepass password
		
		keytool -genkeypair -alias clientkey -keyalg RSA -dname "CN=localhost,OU=Organization Unit,O=Organization,L=City,S=State,C=IN" -keypass password -storepass password -keystore clientkeystore.jks
	
	Install the client’s public certificate in to the server’s keystore
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
		keytool -exportcert -alias clientkey -file client-public.cer -keystore clientkeystore.jks -storepass password
		
		keytool -importcert -keystore serverkeystore.jks -alias clientcert -file client-public.cer -storepass password -noprompt
		
	Export the Server’s Public Certificate and Import it in to the client’s Keystore
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		keytool -exportcert -alias serverkey -file server-public.cer -keystore serverkeystore.jks -storepass password
		
		keytool -importcert -keystore clientkeystore.jks -alias servercert -file server-public.cer -storepass password -noprompt
	

Server.java#start_server_without_ssl
=======================================
	Bootstraps the server. 
	
	It has basic auth, wsse security token as in interceptor.
	
	It also has out and fault interceptors.
	
	Interceptors prints messages on server console.
	
Client.java#JaxWsProxyFactoryBean_based_client
=================================================
	Has client code using JaxWsProxyFactoryBean. But It does not have any wsse or basic auth headers.

Client.java#soap_service_based_client
=======================================
	Has client code using SoapService. But It does not have any wsse or basic auth headers.
	
SOAP UI Project
================
	Also has client and is best to use these clients as basic auth and wsse security headers can be easily specified.
	
	Mock services are of limited use as tricky to specify basic auth and wsse security setup. Moreover that wouldn't be of cxf formats. Hence
	can not be used in real projects.
